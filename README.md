Following details are collected from Cloude3 AI tool.

 
Race Conditions Cases
-
  - Race conditions in lazy initialization 
  - Improper use of ThreadLocal leading to memory leaks 
  - Deadlocks due to inconsistent lock ordering 
  - Over-synchronization leading to performance issues 
  - Incorrect assumptions about atomicity of operations 
  - Misuse of the volatile keyword 
  - Failure to properly manage thread pools 
  - Incorrect use of CountDownLatch 
  - Memory consistency errors with non-volatile long and double 
  - Incorrect implementation of custom locks 
  - Misuse of Timer 
  - Incorrect assumptions about HashMap thread-safety 
  - Deprecated use of Thread.stop()
  - Incorrect handling of InterruptedException 
  - Race conditions in singleton lazy initialization 
  - Misuse of thread priorities 
  - Incorrect assumptions about atomicity of increment operations
  - Incorrect use of ThreadLocal with thread pools 
  - Incorrect implementation of non-blocking algorithms 
  - Incorrect use of wait/notify with condition predicates 
  - Incorrect handling of exceptions in ForkJoinTask 
  - Incorrect use of volatile for compound actions 
  - Incorrect assumptions about thread safety of concurrent collections 
  - Incorrect use of Condition variables 
  - Incorrect handling of InterruptedException in executors 
  - Incorrect use of ThreadLocalRandom 
  - Incorrect implementation of object pooling 
  - Incorrect use of StatelessFactorizer 
  - Incorrect use of ThreadLocal for per-request context 
  - Incorrect assumptions about memory visibility in busy-wait loops 
  - Incorrect use of weak references in caches
